# Lab-1: Graph and Matrix Operations

## Programs

### 1. first.py - Graph Adjacency Matrix
Creates an adjacency matrix representation of an undirected graph.

**Input:**
- Number of vertices
- Number of edges
- Vertex pairs for each edge

**Output:**
- Adjacency matrix where 1 represents an edge between vertices

### 2. second.py - Matrix Comparison
Compares two matrices and finds misplaced elements.

**Input:**
- Matrix dimensions (rows and columns)
- Elements for matrix 1
- Elements for matrix 2

**Output:**
- List of misplaced elements (elements that differ between matrices)

## How to Run
```bash
python first.py
python second.py
```
